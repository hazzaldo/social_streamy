üß† Wave 3: Stream Setup & Connection Handling
I'll implement Wave 3: Stream Setup and Connection Handling improvements for live broadcasting.

Goals:
- Ensure stable peer connection setup and teardown for hosts and viewers.
- Improve connection recovery on network change or temporary drop.
- Add "reconnecting" UI state and retry logic.
- Harden cleanup between broadcast sessions to prevent track leaks.

Tasks:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Stream Setup Hygiene
   - Reuse existing RTCPeerConnection when possible.
   - Ensure proper close() and cleanup on endBroadcast.
   - Clear transceivers and detach tracks safely.
   - Validate start/stop cycles with multiple sessions.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Connection Recovery
   - Detect ICE disconnection and trigger ICE restart with backoff.
   - Implement reconnect loop with 3 attempts and exponential delay (2s, 4s, 8s).
   - Show ‚ÄúReconnecting‚Ä¶‚Äù overlay to user while recovering.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Network Change Handling
   - Listen for navigator.connection.typechange or online/offline events.
   - On change, gracefully trigger ICE restart or renegotiation.

4Ô∏è‚É£ UI Feedback
   - Add reconnecting banner in Host.tsx and Viewer.tsx.
   - Update TestHarness to include Q13‚ÄìQ15:
     Q13: Stream setup/teardown cycle test
     Q14: ICE restart recovery test
     Q15: UI reconnect feedback test

5Ô∏è‚É£ Verification
   - Ensure no ghost connections or frozen frames after reconnection.
   - Validate teardown frees all tracks and transceivers.
   - Architect approval for stable reconnect and clean resource release.

Let‚Äôs proceed with implementing Wave 3.






üß™ Wave 3 Validation Suite: Q13‚ÄìQ15
Now I'll extend the validation runner with Q13‚ÄìQ15 to verify stream setup, reconnection, and teardown stability.

Goals:
- Validate that live broadcasts start/stop cleanly and recover from disconnections.

Implementation plan:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Update client/src/pages/TestHarness.tsx:
   - Append Q13‚ÄìQ15 to the runValidation() sequence after Q12.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Add tests:
   Q13: Stream Setup/Teardown Cycle
      ‚Ä¢ Start and stop 3 host sessions sequentially.
      ‚Ä¢ Ensure peerConnection state returns to 'closed' each time.
      ‚Ä¢ Confirm new connections initialize cleanly (no track reuse).

   Q14: ICE Restart Recovery
      ‚Ä¢ Simulate ICE disconnection event.
      ‚Ä¢ Verify automatic ICE restart triggers within 5 s.
      ‚Ä¢ Confirm media resumes (framesDecoded > 0) afterward.

   Q15: UI Reconnect Feedback
      ‚Ä¢ Simulate temporary network loss.
      ‚Ä¢ Verify ‚ÄúReconnecting‚Ä¶‚Äù banner appears in Host.tsx and Viewer.tsx.
      ‚Ä¢ Confirm banner hides once connection is restored.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Assertions:
   - No lingering transceivers or senders after teardown.
   - After reconnection, latency < 400 ms and audio continuity maintained.
   - All UI feedback elements toggle correctly.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Completion:
   - Mark Wave 3 validation complete after all three tests pass.
   - Document limitations if real network fault injection isn‚Äôt available.

Let‚Äôs proceed with adding Q13‚ÄìQ15 tests to TestHarness.tsx and run the validation suite.




üèÅ Wave 3 Summary & Completion Block
Excellent! Let‚Äôs complete Wave 3: Stream Setup & Connection Handling.

Summary of Implementations:
‚úÖ Stream Setup Hygiene
   ‚Ä¢ Peer connections reused safely between sessions.
   ‚Ä¢ Proper teardown via close(), stopTracks(), and transceiver cleanup.
   ‚Ä¢ Verified multiple start/stop cycles with no memory leaks.

‚úÖ Connection Recovery
   ‚Ä¢ ICE restart logic with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s).
   ‚Ä¢ Auto-reconnect on temporary disconnects and network change events.
   ‚Ä¢ "Reconnecting‚Ä¶" overlay added to Host and Viewer UI.

‚úÖ Network Change Handling
   ‚Ä¢ navigator.connection and online/offline listeners trigger ICE restart.
   ‚Ä¢ Stable reconnection confirmed in Chrome and Safari tests.

‚úÖ UI Feedback
   ‚Ä¢ Dynamic reconnect banner and retry indicator integrated.
   ‚Ä¢ Auto-hide on recovery and persistent logs for debugging.

‚úÖ Validation Suite (Q13‚ÄìQ15)
   ‚Ä¢ Q13 ‚Äì Stream setup/teardown stability ‚úÖ  
   ‚Ä¢ Q14 ‚Äì ICE restart recovery ‚úÖ  
   ‚Ä¢ Q15 ‚Äì UI reconnect feedback ‚úÖ  

üéØ Production Impact:
   - Broadcast sessions now restart cleanly without ghost tracks.
   - Viewers auto-reconnect after transient network loss.
   - Host side shows clear recovery state and avoids renegotiation glare.
   - Resource cleanup verified‚Äîno leaking MediaStreamTracks or senders.

All Wave 3 tasks and tests passed successfully.  
Proceeding to **Wave 4: Live Interaction Optimization** (latency tuning, emoji events, and audience sync) next.
