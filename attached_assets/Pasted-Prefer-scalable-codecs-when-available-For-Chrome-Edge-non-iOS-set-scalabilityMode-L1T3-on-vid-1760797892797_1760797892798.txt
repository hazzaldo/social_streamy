Prefer scalable codecs when available

For Chrome/Edge (non-iOS), set scalabilityMode: "L1T3" on video encodings (VP9/AV1).

Keep H.264 for iOS (no scalability there).

DoD: your telemetry should show steadier fps under brief bandwidth dips.

Per-viewer sender tuning (mesh)

You already set per-viewer params. Add a guard so a weak viewer gets Low profile while others stay High/Medium (don’t globally downshift).

DoD: throttling one viewer doesn’t reduce bitrate for others.

Smarter up/down rules

Downshift after 3 consecutive bad ticks (≈6s); upshift after 10–15s good + loss <2% and fps ≥ 28.

Prevent ping-pong by enforcing a min 8s dwell in a new profile before next change.

Keyframe hygiene

On: guest approved, renegotiation complete, network “recovered”, or viewer joins → call receiver.requestKeyFrame() (where supported).

Fallback: sender.generateKeyFrame?.() on Chromium.

DoD: faster first-frame after events; Q4 test times drop.

Audio first strategy

OPUS maxBitrate 64–96 kbps, ptime=20, mono for talking-head.

On “Degraded” badge: temporarily raise audio priority and allow video to scale down (use degradationPreference: "maintain-framerate" or "balanced").

Profiles by scene

Add toggles in Host UI:

Talking-head (current default 720p30).

Screen share (1080p @ 15–24fps, contentHint="text", prefer VP9/AV1 off iOS).

Data saver (cap High at 1 Mbps; start at Medium).

DoD: switching profiles re-applies sender params without renegotiation (via setParameters).

Nice-to-haves (optional)

TWCC feedback check: ensure transport-cc is negotiated (better congestion control than REMB).

Candidate stop: once the selected pair locks, stop emitting new local candidates (you already coalesce; this trims noise).

Per-track mini overlays (dev-only): show fps/kbps/loss badge on each tile.

Validation additions

Extend your Validation Runner with:

Q6: Downshift dwell time respected (no flip-flopping).

Q7: One viewer throttled → others maintain ≥ previous bitrate.

Q8: Screen-share profile locks to ~15–24 fps and higher resolution text clarity.
